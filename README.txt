README!

Hi Matt!

To run the things I am sending you you'll need to install a few things:
- pip
- selenium (2.0.1)
- you will need the 'geckodriver' as well
- django (I use 1.11)

typically I run things with the default python I have, I believe is python3, but I think django is using python2.7

To install them and get acquainted, follow these links:
http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/

It may take a while to get everything running... if you have any issues let me know. I can run everything perfectly fine like this, you shouldn't need to do any migrations or anything special...

---------------------------------------------------------------

Here you'll find the following folders:

1. SeleniumCodes: has the scraping codes. A folder "Initial attemps" with some basic descriptions, "DAL" for delta - the one running - and "AA" for american

2. SearchCode: this is a set of file examples ("dataset") and the python code I use to find stuff in them

3. WebCode: the django part that keeps the thing runnin. There is a "Desgin" folder with an initial idea of how it could look like, and the "att1" django project with the "findr" app

4. Database: both neo4j and the users sql structure
